Portfolio Website built using Next, Tailwind, and Typescript. 
- Done this way to learn and play around with Typescript and Tailwind. 
- Eventually want to expand on this and build something more complex using typescript.

Template used is the T3-Stack, available @ https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app. 

To-Do: 
1. Finishing Light and Dark mode  
2. Add another cool graphic/3D animation for the contact/footer.


Site is currently deployed and is available at amaarm.com
